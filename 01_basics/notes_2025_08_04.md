# SQL Notes - 2025-08-04

## Topics Covered
- SELECT, FROM, WHERE
- BETWEEN Operator (PostgreSQL)

## Key Learning
- SQL Statements end with ;
- 'BETWEEN' is inclusive on both sides is PostgreSQL
- when writing a condition in SQL that includes multiple conditions for a single column, you have to repeat the column name. For eg. price > 1000 and price < 4000
- when doing a LIKE match in SQL, the % signs are inside the single quote - NOT outside. For eg. WHERE name LIKE 'R%'
- the _ character is used to match exactly one character. For eg. `_atherine` to match Katherine or Catherine
- NULL is not zero. To find and exclude NULLs you have to use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL
- AND conditions are evaluated before OR so make sure to use parantheses for complicated conditionals
