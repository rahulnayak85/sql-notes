# SQL Notes - 2025-08-05

## Topics Covered
- JOINs
- Sequence of Operations in SQL

## Key Learning
- JOINs are used to get data from 2 or more tables ;
- SQL has a logical way of executing queries
  - First, the smallest dataset (by columns) is found - therefore joins are executed
  - then, the dataset is reduced further in terms of rows - where conditions are executed
  - then, only relevant columns are brought in - select is executed
  - finally, sorting and then limiting are done
  - the actual order though is decided by the query engine.
  - in bigquery - this is seen by using EXPLAIN before the full query
